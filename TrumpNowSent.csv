Escape the wrath that is to come!!<br>Did you know the bible says most people are going to Hell? There is a narrow road to get to Heaven and very few find it? Why is this? Because we are dead in trespasses and unable to have full revelation of the bible and God’s will for our lives. We need the merciful gift from God of regeneration. This is where God brings us to life and leads us to repentance and the turning away from a life of sin and leads us to accept him as our Lord and Savior. We become servants of Christ rather than slaves of sin. The bible says unless a man be born again he will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The bible says we must examine ourselves to be sure we are in the faith! Is your eternity assured? Have you been reborn from above? I pray today that you will ask the Holy Spirit to regenerate you, teach you his word, and lead you to him if he hasn’t already<br>Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost<br>Matthew 19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#39;s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<br>If you continue in my word you are my disciple indeed<br>Give thanks in everything for this is the will of God concerning you<br>I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth<br>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints",0.9897

The Libertarian conference booed at Trump the whole night.  This Nascar was not there for Trump. I am from the UK and watch all US media channels and am totally amazed at Fox that to me is closer to Putin&#39;s state media channels that just tell obvious lies. I am starting to see Americans getting more and more stupid every day. I feel sorry for the ones that have a better education having to deal with such stupidity. In Europe a channel like Fox would be a fringe joke station.",0.2192

A cult is typically led by a charismatic, self-appointed leader, requiring unwavering devotion to a set of beliefs. A cult isolates members by depicting the ‘outside’ as corrupt, evil and violent. This increases bonding as members see themselves as &#39;threatened victims&#39;. Growing paranoia make questioning the cult impossible. Cultic behaviours can have devastating effects on the brain and people’s lives. They disable critical thinking processes and freeze emotional processing to both gain and maintain control over their members, often taking advantage of vulnerable people in search of comfort and identity. Resulting negative outcomes can include dishonouring the family unit, no tolerance for questions or critical inquiry, allegiance to their leaders authoritarianism. If this sounds like you, or someone you know, then they are most likely a Trump voter…you can get help - many people are able to recover from being in a cult and go on to lead successful and happy lives.",0.2732

I just don&#39;t believe that criminals, convicted felons, misdemeanors, corrupt and law-breaking individuals should get a shot at being the President of the U.S. They will be rebellious, will not uphold the rule of law, will not respect the Constitution and should not be allowed to be elected to the highest office of the land to protect a Democracy and work for the American people.  They will NEVER DO that and so our qualifications for office need to be rewritten.  These people running campaigns are radicalized and will always work to develop a dictatorship or totalitarian style government.  If Trump gets into office, we only have ourselves to blame.  In this day and age, the rules of our Democracy are beginning to look as though things are just &#39;too open&#39; without discretion.  That&#39;s my opinion but the world has gotten much more dangerous and we need greater security in place.
