There is a narrow road to get to Heaven and very few find it? Why is this? Because we are dead in trespasses and unable to have full revelation of the bible and God’s will for our lives. We need the merciful gift from God of regeneration. This is where God brings us to life and leads us to repentance and the turning away from a life of sin and leads us to accept him as our Lord and Savior. We become servants of Christ rather than slaves of sin. The bible says unless a man be born again he will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The bible says we must examine ourselves to be sure we are in the faith! Is your eternity assured? Have you been reborn from above? I pray today that you will ask the Holy Spirit to regenerate you, teach you his word, and lead you to him if he hasn’t already<br>Titus 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost<br>Matthew 19:28 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#39;s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.<br>If you continue in my word you are my disciple indeed<br>Give thanks in everything for this is the will of God concerning you<br>I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth<br>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints"

@ImWilson1,2024-05-27T16:30:36Z,2024-05-27T16:30:36Z,0,I wonder does Trump salute Amazing Grace when it is sung at church? What a moron. Walking around saluting isn&#39;t patriotic it is delusional. He saluted a garbage can for God&#39;s sake. And Childress placing his hand over his heart looked so uncomfortable. I bet he is sorry he invited this clown.

The sad fact about all this is how a lot of them are standing there carrying a Bible in their hand while inferring that they have all the answers to our problems. Astonishing! I&#39;m not a Joe Biden supporter. However, the only reason Trump was there was to garner votes. If this man gets elected the only thing that&#39;s going to happen here is the federal deficit will go through the roof and people such as real estate agents or the real estate industry and mortgage originators and most people who are on commission sales will make some money. Most of the American people who are middle class will be left behind. Those are the facts!"

Remember when you were in school and you were in gym class and you were playing volleyball or dodgeball and you picked a team captain And then the team captain picked the best player for his team and you may know somebody there that’s like a Joe Biden that you happen to be good friends with, but you know he has no athletic skills whatsoever and the only way you’re going to pick him if he’s the last one that wasn’t picked This is the same thing.

@paultruong6390,2024-05-27T06:54:50Z,2024-05-27T06:54:50Z,0,"June 27, 2024 If Donald Trump wants to debate Joe Biden, he must have a live audience to testify. If CNN &amp; ABC will edit the video, and when Joe Biden cannot answer, the TV station will cut it off. So no one knows how fake the competition is.   Donald Trump has to think twice when giving debate conditions. If Trump doesn&#39;t debate, Joe Biden also has to lose to Donald Trump. I hope Alina Habba has to remind Trump to be careful. If President Trump wants to expose Joe Biden, he has to have an audience to do it. The evidence has just exposed the left-wing media and left Joe Biden under pressure and finally had to give in. Trump went into the tiger&#39;s den to capture the king tiger, the right-wing media will be boycotted by the American people, otherwise the debate will only It&#39;s only one way. Joe Biden speaks and Trump cuts off the audio, CNN &amp; ABC will cover up the real voice. <br>   President Trump is smart enough, but without a plan, Trump is too eager to win and will lose. Joe Biden debates, Trump cannot expose Joe Biden, but the left-wing media who spread fake news to expose President Trump will suffer. be insulting"

@lib5406,2024-05-27T05:57:50Z,2024-05-27T05:57:50Z,0,"Have you heard the story of &#39;The Snake&#39;? Cult members can show a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing. A cult is typically led by a charismatic, self-appointed leader, requiring unwavering devotion to a set of beliefs. A cult isolates members by depicting the ‘outside’ as corrupt, evil and violent. This increases bonding as members see themselves as &#39;threatened victims&#39;. Growing paranoia make questioning the cult impossible. Cultic behaviours can have devastating effects on the brain and people’s lives. They disable critical thinking processes and freeze emotional processing to both gain and maintain control over their members, often taking advantage of vulnerable people in search of comfort and identity. Resulting negative outcomes can include dishonouring the family unit, no tolerance for questions or critical inquiry, allegiance to their leaders authoritarianism. If this sounds like you, or someone you know, then they are most likely a Trump voter…you can get help - many people are able to recover from being in a cult and go on to lead successful and happy lives."

As the Israeli military continues to escalate its ground incursion in Rafah, these cases also illustrate the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns.<br><br>“The cases documented here illustrate a clear pattern of attacks over the past seven months in which the Israeli military has flouted international law, killing Palestinian civilians with total impunity and displaying a callous disregard for human lives.”"

If he misspoke and was 19 the story about not going because he was a wide receiver and didn’t want to go because of half back Joe Bellino and quarterback Roger Staybach. doesn’t make sense since Bellino graduated when Biden was 19 and Staubach was relatively unknown as a plebe.

Just the fact he knew about the weapons and encouraged them to storm the capital and the fact he targeted Mike Pence should be chargable in itself !!!

It&#39;s also been proven that Trump holds the distinction of being the individual to have lost the most money in American history. Add to that that historians have ranked Trump as the worst President in our nation&#39;s history.<br><br>As much as I loathe Sen. Lindsey Graham, before he handed Trump his backbone, Graham got one thing right when he characterized Trump as &quot;a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.&quot; Cruz, Rubio and others have likewise spoken truths about Trump, only to hand over their own spines in time.

Was it the Americans who set up October 7 or the demolishment of Gaza ?? Absolutely not !!!  I don&#39;t hear the GOP going after Russia or Israel......and it is so low that little sign Trump has on his podium...of how Biden has open borders while it was Trump who told his bootlickers not to vote for new policies at the border to make it far more difficult...are Americans so blind ??

There are a number of very specific ways by which our brains fails if we have dementia.  Trump shows us ALL of them all the time.  He simply cannot say a word he wants to say--remember &quot;origins&quot; came out as &quot;oranges&quot; over and over?  Well, he&#39;s doing that all the time now, and often can&#39;t find a real word to substitute.  He also purposely uses fake words he makes up, and he just gives up on phrases or words.  He groans and gives up. These all have names, often with the word &quot;phasia&quot; in them...don&#39;t ask me for more details...  He&#39;s also finding himself in places and saying things he has no clue what they are about--Hannibal Lecter, Jimmy Conners, Gettysburg...  He&#39;s getting much worse and his falling asleep in court is part of it--he can&#39;t control himself as his brain decays.  Dr. Gartner has his own podcast with other doctors and guests, too.  Trump would not last another 4 yrs and that would trigger a dictator replacement battle the US has no experience with."

@stocksgoupward5922,2024-05-25T13:38:02Z,2024-05-25T13:39:14Z,0,Trump wanted a secure border. For SPITE Biden has an open border. Is this for the good of the country?  Biden has 1000s of service man fired for not getting covid shots. Then he lets in millions with no shots?? Trumps wall for Border would cost 15 billion. Where is money coming from? Then we give 175 billion to Ukraine. Go Back to Trump and seriously Democrats are worried he will become a dictator? Please. No wars when Trump was president

Biden is a joke, his policies have brought war and financial ruin to the US and the western world..  De Niro is super rich and &quot;Hollywood,&quot; he has no idea what the working classes go through to put food on the table. When Trump was in there were no wars and the financial situation for the US was booming.  He wanted to build on US natural reserves  and to protect your borders.  All I know is that if Biden remains America will end up in a war with Russia.  I think even Trump is preferable to that.  But perhaps war would cover up the corruption of the Democrats.  Never mind the fact these Masters of War kill millions of innocents you guys hate Trump.  What a waste of energy.  Instead roll up your sleeves and build something different for yourselves.  Anyway, . your government is a war mongering scandal, a policeman of the world, now hated worldwide.

I just don&#39;t believe that criminals, convicted felons, misdemeanors, corrupt and law-breaking individuals should get a shot at being the President of the U.S. They will be rebellious, will not uphold the rule of law, will not respect the Constitution and should not be allowed to be elected to the highest office of the land to protect a Democracy and work for the American people.  They will NEVER DO that and so our qualifications for office need to be rewritten.  These people running campaigns are radicalized and will always work to develop a dictatorship or totalitarian style government.  If Trump gets into office, we only have ourselves to blame.  In this day and age, the rules of our Democracy are beginning to look as though things are just &#39;too open&#39; without discretion.  That&#39;s my opinion but the world has gotten much more dangerous and we need greater security in place. Those running to take over the country for political power, gain and capturing the Treasury, as well as pocketing campaign money do not help develop our nation one bit.

Steve Kornacki is now indicating that NEITHER Biden nor Trump will win the election with the required &quot;270&quot; votes.  They will fall short, therefore, enabling the House of Representatives to make the final vote for the next President of the United States.  Since the House is currently Republican majority, they will naturally select Trump.  This is not over yet, but if Biden doesn&#39;t get to 270, it will be over for the Democratic incumbent.  This latest development is due to Nebraska not having a &#39;winner take all&#39; approach to awarding electoral votes.  The other state is Maine."

Want to believe me? Take a look at corporate revenues and earnings/profit margins/profits.  How do you think they are reporting the highest level in 70 years? It&#39;s because of the consumer price hikes they passed blaming inflation. If you think they will reduce prices as interest rates go down or to lower their margins, you are kidding.  That is why they hiked up prices so fast. Locking in margins for at least 5 years."

They can&#39;t overcome that in one year but just putting trump down is a questionable tactic, imo. The student loan deal just announced is something but a drop in the bucket. When is the last time any Dem said anything about the minimum wage?<br>They barely acknowledge the struggles of unions across the country. Biden spends all his off time with his ultra-rich friends at expensive resorts and mansions. We could have had Bernie, but for the scheming of the Democratic Party. America would be in a much better place today. Give people a reason to vote FOR you instead of bashing the blob."

His loyalties are to the really, really rich people, of which you are not. $1 million isn&#39;t enough for him and you don&#39;t have it anyway. What he wants from you is your vote so that he can get elected and give great tax breaks to your bosses. Not you! On Social Security? Medicare? Disability? Those rich guys want to get rid of these programs. Remember, Congress has it&#39;s own pension and lifelong Healthcare program. Great for them, not so much for the rest of us. Wanna get rid of illegal aliens at the border? Well, Joe Biden and Demos have tried working on a bi-partisan fix, but Republicans shut it down. But Demos want a humane fix where kids are not separated from their parents. I don&#39;t know. Maybe Demos don&#39;t have all the answers but it seems to me that flushing 250 years of democracy down the toilet is a bit over the top. Biden may not be a great answer (I think he is, but it&#39;s your choice). But tRump is NO answer. 😮"

Consider the resent Libertarian Party Convention following for an early example:<br><br>Republicans In Name Only (RINO) and Libertarians In Name Only (LINO), May Appear Different Outside, But Inside Their DNC Socialist Spots Are Alike:<br><br>After watching this year&#39;s 2024 Libertarian Party Convention, in whose members in attendance were white only, has their own RNIO (who are also mostly white) like sub-group operating within their ranks.<br><br>RINOs are DNC liberals within, and LINOs are DNC liberal socialist within. I believe, if these two subversive a-moral groups formed together, they&#39;d be able to rise up an anarchist state by which to erode the Republic of America from within.  Maybe that&#39;s why many of the Libertarian party and RINOs vote democrat.  <br><br>Now, all this being said, I believe former President Trump exemplified a brave heart, and steeling composure, in addressing such a disrespectful, condescending, self-centered, egotistical, inconsiderate crew I&#39;ve been able to witness in a somewhat controlled environment. <br><br>Kind of remined me of antifa and/or a college campus of Marxist indoctrinated socialist students.<br><br>The libertarians I listen to, are thoughtful, good communication skills, insightful points of reasoning, and even a degree of dry humor. Now true, they are determined in their positions held.  <br><br>However, this being said, the actions of those here at this convention, I can&#39;t fathom them having that degree of animosity, especially from hearing a former President in line with many of the positions supposably held by them.  <br><br>Former President Trump even went a step higher, by actually establishing in policies, many positions similar to &quot;supposably&quot; held by Libertarians. <br><br>This is why; after seeing him stand up in front of a crew of malcontents as these, many of the Libertarians outwardly representing here, are inwardly LINO&#39;s.<br><br>My advice to Former President Trump, and the MAGA Party, when it comes to Republicans and Libertarians, as President Reagan used in discussion with Gorbachev of Russian, trust but, verify. <br><br>RINO’s and LINO’s, may appear different outside, but inside their spots are alike.

CNN does not tell you the News but like MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NPR and NY Times and Washington Compost are propaganda for the Democrats pretty close to the last fifty years but more so now.  They don&#39;t talk about the issues like the Biden open door policy, the Biden corrupts, they went forward with the Russia Hoax and have not apologize to the American public.  They try to twist the truth or bend it.  Don&#39;t like Trump the way he talks sometimes but he is more truthful than the current occupant of the White House (can I still say White) Joe Biden who has work and done every occupation in his mind and lied about every thing."
